title: Hello World!

# Welcome
---
> Hello World! I am qkuldo, a starting game developer, currently creating a game called Bumpgun.
> This post will be about the plans I'm making for the game. 
## How it started
-----
> This whole thing started after I took a hiatus at coding due to me abandoning my "big game" Echo Of the Angels.
> After coming up with the basic idea for the game, I brainstormed 4 major plans I have for the game.
> But first, what was this basic idea?
## The basic idea
---
> The basic idea was based off frogs jumping from wall to wall in an enclosed space.
> Frogs were too generic and boring, so I instead made it a robot that looked like a bug with a big cannon on the front.
> Since there would be enemies in the game, I decided that the robot would shoot a limited amount of energy bullets from the cannon, but I didn't want for it to be able to do this while jumping.
>So I made the robot able to switch between 2 modes, where the first you could use to jump, whilst the second had the cannon open so you could use to fire the energy bullets.
>I haven't developed this part yet, but I imagine that there are certain "charging stations" in the level that you would have to activate and use to regain all the energy bullets, but every time you used it, there was a cooldown of 30 seconds that increased based on the difficulty.
## Future Plans
---
>I want to add a ton of stuff to this game, but I decided to resist Scope Creep to create 5 basic ideas for the game.
### 1: Levels
---
> I'm planning to have 20 levels in each location (which I've called Infestations), and in levels 5 and 15, there will be minibosses, but levels 10 and 20 will have a boss.
> There will be 4 Infestations (Which means 80 levels. Yikes!), and you can complete them in any order, like the Megaman games.
### 2: Rankings
---
> There will be 5 ranks: Busted, Rusty, Fine, Great, and Perfect.
> Whatever rank you get will be based of the amount of damage you took, the speed you completed the level, and the score you got from defeating enemies or collecting items.
### 3: Items
---
> Items are obtainable from bosses and enemies.
> Bosses only have a 100% chance to drop 1 specific item, whilst enemies drop certain items more commonly than others, or don't drop any. 
> Items can give basic bonuses if you equip them in one of your 5 item slots, like increasing items dropped from enemies, or getting a 25% chance of shooting 2 bullets with only 1 piece of ammo.
### 4: Upgrades
---
> Upgrades require 1 or more of a specific item, usually obtained through achievements or by the items dropped from certain bosses.
> They can give big bonuses that stay forever, like being able to brake to stop your jump and damage enemies, or gain a new melee attack when you're not in gun mode.
> However, certain upgrades are not compatible with each other, so you really have to choose wisely.
## Goodbye

>Thank you for making it to the end of this blog. I hope you will read my other blogs in the future.
